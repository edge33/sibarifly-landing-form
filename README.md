# SibariFly landing form

React 19 + TypeScript application built with Vite 8 and React Compiler.

## Development

Use Node.js 24 (as in CI; minimum 22.12) and the pnpm version pinned in
`package.json`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

## Code quality

Biome handles linting, formatting, and import organization. Its configuration
is in `biome.json`, with lint rules migrated from the previous configuration,
including React Hooks and Fast Refresh checks. Formatting uses two spaces,
single quotes in JavaScript/TypeScript, semicolons, and optional arrow parentheses.
Biome respects `.gitignore` and excludes build output.

```sh
pnpm lint          # Check lint rules; warnings fail the check
pnpm lint:fix      # Apply safe lint fixes
pnpm format        # Format supported files
pnpm format:check  # Check formatting without modifying files
pnpm check         # Check lint, formatting, and import organization
pnpm build         # Type-check and build for production
```

Use the [Biome editor extension](https://biomejs.dev/editors/first-party-extensions/)
for editor diagnostics and formatting. Markdown and other unsupported formats are
maintained manually.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` on pushes and pull requests.
The workflow uses Node.js 24, the pnpm version pinned in `package.json`, and a
frozen lockfile. It can also be started manually from the Actions tab.

## Build tooling

React Compiler runs in development and production through
`@vitejs/plugin-react`'s `reactCompilerPreset` and `@rolldown/plugin-babel`,
following the [React Compiler Vite setup](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation#vite).
It automatically memoizes eligible components and hooks; manual `use memo`
directives are unnecessary. Keep renders pure and use reactive subscriptions
(such as React Hook Form's `useWatch`) for values that drive the UI.

Tailwind CSS 4 uses `@tailwindcss/vite`. The stylesheet explicitly loads the
existing JavaScript theme and Flowbite sources, with class-based dark mode.
Tailwind 4 requires Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, or Firefox 128+.

The pnpm overrides keep transitive Rollup 4 and YAML 2 dependencies on patched
versions for GHSA-mw96-cpmx-2vgc and GHSA-48c2-rrv3-qjmp. Revisit these overrides
when upstream dependencies no longer resolve vulnerable versions.
